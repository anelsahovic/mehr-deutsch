# Mehr Deutsch

Mehr Deutsch is a modern **React + TypeScript Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed to help users master German grammar — especially **noun gender** — through interactive practice cards, theory pages, and progress tracking.

For now, the app includes the **Noun Gender Practice**, but more grammar topics and exercises will be added soon.
